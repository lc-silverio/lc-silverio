### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm LuÃ­s SilvÃ©rio
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile.
![Welcome to my GitHub profile.]

Currently writing from Lisbon - Portugal. At the moment i'm a college student on my 3rd year of Computer Engineering and i've been working for the past 9 years as an IT Tech on a company that gave me a wide skill set. 

I'm currently studying HTML/CSS, JS, JAVA, Python, C# and Android app development. I'm interested in tech in general but one most of my focus goes to design, UX/UI, design and diy. Could be defined as a maker but to be honest i'm just curious about the tech world and like to know how things tick.

As hobbies in tech i'm interesting in GameDev, UX/UI and design.
