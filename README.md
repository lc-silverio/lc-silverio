### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm LuÃ­s SilvÃ©rio
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile.

Currently writing from Lisbon - Portugal. At the moment i'm a junior dev working and i've been working for the past 10 years in IT which gave me a wide skill set. 

I'm currently studying C# / .NET, Angular as well as UI/UX. 

I'm interested in tech in general but most of my focus goes to coding, design, UX/UI, Game Dev and diy. I could be defined as a creative/maker/diy'er but to be honest i'm just curious about the tech world and how things tick.

As hobbies in tech i'm interesting in GameDev, UX/UI and Design
