### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm LuÃ­s SilvÃ©rio from Lisbon - Portugal and welcome to my GitHub profile. At the moment i'm a college student on my 3rd year of Computer Engineering and i've been working for the past 9 years as an IT Tech. 

I'm currently studying HTML/CSS, JS, JAVA, Python and C#. I'm interested in tech in general but one most of my focus goes to design, and UX/UI design.

As hobbies in tech i'm interesting in GameDev, UX/UI and design.
